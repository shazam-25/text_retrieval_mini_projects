    "body": "Hi everyone, I'd like to extend a warm invitation to a team lunch this Friday. We'll be celebrating a successful quarter where we not only met but exceeded our financial targets. This is a great opportunity to relax, connect with colleagues outside of our regular work context, and acknowledge all the hard work everyone has put in. We'll be meeting at noon in the main conference room, and I'll be catering from the new Italian place downtown. Please RSVP to this email by Wednesday so I can get an accurate headcount and place the order. Thank you all for your dedication and outstanding contributions. I look forward to celebrating with you!"
