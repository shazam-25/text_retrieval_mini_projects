"""Reminder: End-of-Year Performance Reviews"",""This is a gentle reminder that end-of-year performance reviews are quickly approaching. This is an important process for evaluating our progress, recognizing achievements, and setting goals for the upcoming year. Please take some time in the coming weeks to prepare a summary of your key achievements, contributions, and professional development from the past year. Think about the projects you led, the targets you met, and any new skills you acquired. The review forms will be available on the HR portal, and your summary is due by December 1st. Your manager will then schedule a one-on-one meeting with you to discuss your performance."""
